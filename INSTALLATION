You need to make symbolic links in /usr/local/share and /usr/local/lib
(or their analogues) to the "local" module directory, eg:

 	  ln -s ~user/igor/local /usr/local/share/chibi
	  ln -s ~user/igor/local /usr/local/lib/chibi

This is needed because there are C functions and Scheme functions
which get loaded dynamically.  In principle, these should be more
closely coupled to the executable, but the flip side is that this is
nice and flexible.


The command 
	 
	 make install

will install igor in /bin, while 

	 make install-links

will (one day) install links.
