You need to make symbolic links in /usr/local/share and /usr/local/lib
(or their analogues) to the "local" module directory, eg:

 	  ln -s ~user/igor/local /usr/local/share/chibi
	  ln -s ~user/igor/local /usr/local/lib/chibi

This is needed because there are C functions and Scheme functions
which get loaded dynamically.  In principle, these should be more
closely coupled to the executable, but the flip side is that this is
nice and flexible.
