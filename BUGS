								 This is OK, I don't mind the cloning of the data.

								 Exactly.  This is what I would have expected after I've read the
								 documentation for the `free` modifier.  Because currently it leaks the
								 original string.

The command
    Yeth? 'abc

doesn't print the symbol 'abc We certainly need to check strings like
"Run Me" for their presence, but (by fiat) we insist that a single
quote is a scheme symbol


2014-08-13-20:34:15 Mysteriously exits (probably something to do with files closing)

RESOLVED 2014-08-13-20:34:53 pipes are *buggered*

2014-08-13-20:35:07 Doesn't appear to be a terminal (more(1) just cats)
						  2014-11-26-16:06:01  Doesn't "cat" now, but never gets terminal input
						  							  "ls -lrt | more"
													  pauses, but never continues.
													  
RESOLVED 2014-08-13-20:36:33 Doesn't dispatch scheme expressions at the moment.




2014-11-26-15:47:45  Things happen in odd orders with sets of s-expressions:
	 Yeth? (begin (display 1)(display 2)(display 3)(newline))
	 123

	 Yeth? (display 1)(display 2)(display 3)(newline)
	 321Yeth?
